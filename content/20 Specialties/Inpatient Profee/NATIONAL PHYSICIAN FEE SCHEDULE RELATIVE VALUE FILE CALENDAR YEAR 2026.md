#### **Contents:**
===
This file contains information on services covered by the **Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS)** in 2026. For more than 10,000 physician services, the file contains the associated relative value units (RVUs), a fee schedule status indicator, and various payment policy indicators needed for payment adjustment (i.e., payment of assistant at surgery, team surgery, bilateral surgery, etc.).

```





The **Medicare physician fee schedule** amounts are adjusted to reflect the variation in practice costs from area to area. A geographic practice cost index (GPCI) has been established for every **Medicare payment locality** for each of the three components of a procedure's relative value unit (**i.e., the RVUs for work, practice expense, and malpractice**). The GPCIs are applied in the calculation of a fee schedule payment amount by multiplying the **RVU** for each component times the GPCI for that component.

**For informational purposes**, changes from the previous year's documentation file are in bold font to facilitate their identification.

- **Section 121 of the Social Security Act Amendments of 1994** required CMS to replace the existing charge-based practice expense relative value units for all **Medicare Physician Fee Schedule services** with new resource-based ones. The **Balanced Budget Act of 1997** requires a four-year transition from the existing charge-based system to the new resource-based system beginning on January 1, 1999. In 2002 and beyond, the practice expense relative value units are based entirely on the resource-based system. Beginning with **CY 2007**, we will use a bottom-up methodology for direct costs, use supplementary survey data for indirect costs, and eliminate the nonphysician workpool in order to calculate the practice expense RVUs. The nonphysician workpool was a special method that has been used to calculate practice expense **RVUs** for services with no physician work.

- Under the resource-based system, we have developed practice expense relative value units specific to the facility and non-facility settings. Generally, under the resource-based system, **the facility practice expense RVUs will be used for services performed in inpatient or outpatient hospital settings, emergency rooms, skilled nursing facilities, or ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs)**. The non-facility practice expense relative value units will be used for services furnished in all other settings. We did not develop non-facility practice expense relative value units for some services which, either by definition or in practice, are never (or rarely) performed in a non-facility setting. For example, by definition, the initial hospital care codes (CPT codes **[[99221]]**-**[[99223]]**) are provided only in the hospital inpatient setting. Also, many major surgical procedures with a **90-day global period** are almost always performed in the hospital inpatient setting. These facility-only codes are identified by a “**NA**” in the “**NA Indicator**” field.

<br>

**The formula for 2026 physician fee schedule payment amount is as follows:**

<br>

- **2026 Non-Facility Pricing Amount =**
    - **[(Work RVU * Work GPCI) +**
    - **(Non-Facility PE RVU * PE GPCI) +**
    - **(MP RVU * MP GPCI)] * Conversion Factor (CF)**

<br>

- **2026 Facility Pricing Amount =**
    - **[(Work RVU * Work GPCI) +**
    - **(Facility PE RVU * PE GPCI) +**
    - **(MP RVU * MP GPCI)] * Conversion Factor**
    - 
<br>

**Certain therapy codes will receive a 50 percent reduction to the PE.**

<br>

- **Section 5102(b) of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005** requires a payment cap on the technical component (TC) of certain diagnostic imaging procedures and the TC portions of the global diagnostic imaging services. This cap is based on the **Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) payment**. To implement this provision, the physician fee schedule amount is compared to the OPPS payment amount and the lower amount is used in the formula below to calculate payment.

- **2026 OPPS Non-Facility Payment Amount =**
	- **[(Work RVU * Work GPCI) + (OPPS Non-Facility PE RVU * PE GPCI) +**
	- **(OPPS MP RVU * MP GPCI)] * Conversion Factor**

- **2026 OPPS Facility Payment Amount =**
	**[Work RVU * Work GPCI) + (OPPS Facility PE RVU * PE GPCI) +**
	**(OPPS MP RVU * MP GPCI)] * Conversion Factor**


We are **attaching/including** the 2026 locality-specific anesthesia conversion factors (CFs) and they are calculated from the 2026 national anesthesia CF whose calculation is described in the CY 2026 final physician fee schedule regulation.

The **Medicare** limiting charge is set by law at 115 percent of the payment amount for the service furnished by the nonparticipating physician. However, the law sets the payment amount for nonparticipating physicians at 95 percent of the payment amount for participating physicians (i.e., the fee schedule amount). Calculating 95 percent of 115 percent of an amount is equivalent to multiplying the amount by a factor of 1.0925 (or 109.25 percent). Therefore, to calculate the **Medicare** limiting charge for a physician service for a locality, multiply the fee schedule amount by a factor of 1.0925. The result is the **Medicare** limiting charge for that service for that locality to which the fee schedule amount applies.

**Indicates applicable payment adjustment rule for multiple procedures:**

===
- **0** = No payment adjustment rules for multiple procedures apply. If procedure is reported on the same day as another procedure, base the payment on the lower of (a) the actual charge, or (b) the fee schedule amount for the procedure.

- **1** = Standard payment adjustment rules in effect before January 1, 1995 for multiple procedures apply. In the 1995 file, this indicator only applies to codes with a status code of "D". If procedure is reported on the same day as another procedure that has an indicator of 1, 2, or 3, rank the procedures by fee schedule amount and apply the appropriate reduction to this code (100%, 50%, 26%, and by report). Base the payment on the lower of (a) the actual charge, or (b) the fee schedule amount reduced by the appropriate percentage.

- **2** = Standard payment adjustment rules for multiple procedures apply. If procedure is reported on the same day as another procedure with an indicator of 1, 2, or 3, rank the procedures by fee schedule amount and apply the appropriate reduction to this code (100%, 50%, 50%, 50%, 50% and by report). Base the payment on the lower of (a) the actual charge, or (b) the fee schedule amount reduced by the appropriate percentage.

- **3** = Special rules for multiple endoscopic procedures apply if procedure is billed with another endoscopy in the same family (i.e., another endoscopy that has the same base procedure). The base procedure for each code with this indicator is identified in the Endobase field of this file. Apply the multiple endoscopy rules to a family before ranking the family with the other procedures performed on the same day (for example, if multiple endoscopies in the same family are reported on the same day as endoscopies in another family or on the same day as a non-endoscopic procedure). If an endoscopic procedure is reported with only its base procedure, do not pay separately for the base procedure. Payment for the base procedure is included in the payment for the other endoscopy.

- **4** = Special rules for the technical component (TC) of diagnostic imaging procedures apply if procedure is billed with another diagnostic imaging procedure in the same family (per the diagnostic imaging family indicator, below). If procedure is reported in the same session on the same day as another procedure with the same family indicator, rank the procedures by fee schedule amount for the TC. Pay 100% for the highest priced procedure, and 50% for each subsequent procedure. Base the payment for subsequent procedures on the lower of (a) the actual charge, or (b) the fee schedule amount reduced by the appropriate percentage. Subject to 50% reduction of the TC diagnostic imaging (effective for services July 1, 2010 and after). Subject to 25% reduction of the PC of diagnostic imaging (effective for services January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2016). Subject to 5% reduction of the PC of diagnostic imaging (effective for services January 1, 2017 and after).

- **5** = Subject to 50% of the practice expense component for certain therapy services.

- **6** = Subject to 25% reduction of the second highest and subsequent procedures to the TC of diagnostic cardiovascular services, effective for services January 1, 2013, and thereafter.

- **7** = Subject to 20% reduction of the second highest and subsequent procedures to the TC of diagnostic ophthalmology services, effective for services January 1, 2013, and thereafter.

**Bilateral Surgery**

**117-117 x(1)**

===
- **9** = Concept does not apply.

**Indicates services subject to payment adjustment.**

- **0** = 150% payment adjustment for bilateral procedures does not apply. If procedure is reported with modifier -50 or with modifiers RT and LT, base the payment for the two sides on the lower of: (a) the total actual charge for both sides and (b) 100% of the fee schedule amount for a single code. Example: The fee schedule amount for code XXXXX is $125. The physician reports code XXXXX-LT with an actual charge of $100 and XXXXX-RT with an actual charge of $100. Payment should be based on the fee schedule amount ($125) since it is lower than the total actual charges for the left and right sides ($200). The bilateral adjustment is inappropriate for codes in this category (a) because of physiology or anatomy, or (b) because the code description specifically states that it is a unilateral procedure and there is an existing code for the bilateral procedure.

- **1** = 150% payment adjustment for bilateral procedures applies. If the code is billed with the bilateral modifier or is reported twice on the same day by any other means (e.g., with RT and LT modifiers, or with a 2 in the units field), base the payment for these codes when reported as bilateral procedures on the lower of: (a) the total actual charge for both sides or (b) 150% of the fee schedule amount for a single code. If the code is reported as a bilateral procedure and is reported with other procedure codes on the same day, apply the bilateral adjustment before applying any multiple procedure rules.

- **2** = 150% payment adjustment does not apply. RVUs are already based on the procedure being performed as a bilateral procedure. If the procedure is reported with modifier -50 or is reported twice on the same day by any other means (e.g., with RT and LT modifiers or with a 2 in the units field), base the payment for both sides on the lower of (a) the total actual charge by the physician for both sides, or (b) 100% of the fee schedule for a single code. Example: The fee schedule amount for code YYYYY is $125. The physician reports code YYYYY-LT with an actual charge of $100 and YYYYY-RT with an actual charge of $100. Payment should be based on the fee schedule amount ($125) since it is lower than the total actual charges for the left and right sides ($200). The RVUs are based on a bilateral procedure because (a) the code descriptor specifically states that the procedure is bilateral, (b) the code descriptor states that the procedure may be performed either unilaterally or bilaterally, or (c) the procedure is usually performed as a bilateral procedure.

- **3** = The usual payment adjustment for bilateral procedures does not apply. If the procedure is reported with modifier -50 or is reported for both sides on the same day by any other means (e.g., with RT and LT modifiers or with a 2 in the units field), base the payment for each side or organ or site of a paired organ on the lower of (a) the actual charge for each side or (b) 100% of the fee schedule amount for each side. If the procedure is reported as a bilateral procedure and with other procedure codes on the same day, determine the fee schedule amount for a bilateral procedure before applying any multiple procedure rules. Services in this category are generally radiology procedures or other diagnostic tests which are not subject to the special payment rules for other bilateral surgeries.

**STATUS CODE** 

===
**A** = <u>**Active Code**</u>. These codes are paid separately under the physician fee schedule, if covered. There will be RVUs for codes with this status. The presence of an "A" indicator does not mean that Medicare has made a national coverage determination regarding the service; A/B MACs (B) remain responsible for coverage decisions in the absence of a national Medicare policy.

**B** = <u>**Bundled Code**</u>. Payment for covered services are always bundled into payment for other services not specified. If RVUs are shown, they are not used for Medicare payment. If these services are covered, payment for them is subsumed by the payment for the services to which they are incident. (An example is a telephone call from a hospital nurse regarding care of a patient).

**C** = <u>**Contractors price the code**</u>. A/B MACs (B) will establish RVUs and payment amounts for these services, generally on an individual case basis following review of documentation such as an operative report.

**D** = <u>**Deleted Codes**</u>. These codes are deleted effective with the beginning of the applicable year. These codes will not appear on the 2006 file as the grace period for deleted codes is no longer applicable.

**E** = <u>**Excluded from Physician Fee Schedule by regulation**</u>. These codes are for items and/or services that CMS chose to exclude from the fee schedule payment by regulation. No RVUs are shown, and no payment may be made under the fee schedule for these codes. Payment for them, when covered, generally continues under reasonable charge procedures.

**F** = <u>**Deleted/Discontinued Codes**</u>. (Code not subject to a 90 day grace period). These codes will not appear on the 2006 file as the grace period for deleted codes is no longer applicable.

**G** = <u>**Not valid for Medicare purposes**</u>. Medicare uses another code for reporting of, and payment for, these services. (Code subject to a 90 day grace period.) These codes will not appear on the 2006 file as the grace period for deleted codes is no longer applicable.

**H** = <u>**Deleted Modifier**</u>. This code had an associated TC and/or 26 modifier in the previous year. For the current year, the TC or 26 component shown for the code has been deleted, and the deleted component is shown with a status code of "H". These codes will not appear on the 2006 file as the grace period for deleted codes is no longer applicable.

**I** = <u>**Not valid for Medicare purposes**</u>. Medicare uses another code for reporting of, and payment for, these services. (Code <u>NOT</u> subject to a 90 day grace period.)

**J** = <u>**Anesthesia Services**.</u> There are no RVUs and no payment amounts for these codes. The intent of this value is to facilitate the identification of anesthesia services.

**M** = <u>**Measurement codes**.</u> Used for reporting purposes only.

**N** = <u>**Non-covered Services.**</u> These services are not covered by Medicare.

**P** = <u>**Bundled/Excluded Codes.**</u> There are no RVUs and no payment amounts for these services. No separate payment should be made for them under the fee schedule.
 - **If** the item or service is covered as incident to a physician service and is provided on the same day as a physician service, payment for it is bundled into the payment for the physician service to which it is incident. (An example is an elastic bandage furnished by a physician incident to physician service.)
 - **If** the item or service is covered as other than incident to a physician service, it is excluded from the fee schedule (i.e., colostomy supplies) and should be paid under the other payment provision of the Act.

**R** = <u>**Restricted Coverage.**</u> Special coverage instructions apply. If covered, the service is contractor priced. (NOTE: The majority of codes to which this indicator will be assigned are the alpha-numeric dental codes, which begin with "D". We are assigning the indicator to a limited number of CPT codes which represent services that are covered only in unusual circumstances.)

**T** = <u>**Injections**.</u> There are RVUS and payment amounts for these services, but they are only paid if there are no other services payable under the physician fee schedule billed on the same date by the same provider. If any other services payable under the physician fee schedule are billed on the same date by the same provider, these services are bundled into the physician services for which payment is made. (NOTE: This is a change from the previous definition, which states that injection services are bundled into <u>any</u> other services billed on the same date.)

**X** = <u>**Statutory Exclusion.**</u> These codes represent an item or service that is not in the statutory definition of "physician services" for fee schedule payment purposes. No RVUS or payment amounts are shown for these codes, and no payment may be made under the physician fee schedule. (Examples are ambulance services and clinical diagnostic laboratory services.)

**PC/TC INDICATOR**

===
**0** = <u>**Physician Service Codes**</u> -- Identifies codes that describe physician services. Examples include visits, consultations, and surgical procedures. The concept of PC/TC does not apply since physician services cannot be split into professional and technical components. Modifiers [[-26]] and [[-TC]] cannot be used with these codes. The RVUS include values for physician work, practice expense and malpractice expense. There are some codes with no work RVUs.

**1** = <u>**Diagnostic Tests for Radiology Services**</u> -- Identifies codes that describe diagnostic tests. Examples are pulmonary function tests or therapeutic radiology procedures, e.g., radiation therapy. These codes have both a professional and technical component. Modifiers [[-26]] and [[-TC]] can be used with these codes. The total RVUs for codes reported with a [[-26]] modifier include values for physician work, practice expense, and malpracticeexpense. The total RVUs for codes reported with a [[-TC]] modifier include values for practice expense and malpractice expense only. The total RVUs for codes reported without a modifier include values for physician work, practice expense, and malpractice expense.

**2** = <u>**Professional Component Only Codes**</u> -- This indicator identifies stand-alone codes that describe the physician work portion of selected diagnostic tests for which there is an associated code that describes the technical component of the diagnostic test only and another associated code that describes the global test. An example of a professional component only code is CPT code **[[93010]] -- Electrocardiogram; Interpretation and Report.** Modifiers [[-26]] and [[-TC]] cannot be used with these codes. The total RVUs for professional component only codes include values for physician work, practice expense, and malpractice expense.

**3** = <u>**Technical Component Only Codes**</u> -- This indicator identifies stand- alone codes that describe the technical component (i.e., staff and equipment costs) of selected diagnostic tests for which there is an associated code that describes the professional component of the diagnostic test only. An example of a technical component only code is CPT code **[[93005]] -- Electrocardiogram; Tracing Only, without interpretation and report**. It also identifies codes that are covered only as diagnostic tests and therefore do not have a related professional code. Modifiers [[-26]] and [[-TC]] cannot be used with these codes. The total RVUs for technical component only codes include values for practice expense and malpractice expense only.

**4** = <u>**Global Test Only Codes**</u> -- This indicator identifies stand-alone codes that describe selected diagnostic tests for which there are associated codes that describe (a) the professional component of the test only, and (b) the technical component of the test only. Modifiers [[-26]] and [[-TC]] cannot be used with these codes. The total RVUs for global procedure only codes include values for physician work, practice expense, and malpractice expense. The total RVUs for global procedure only codes equals the sum of the total RVUs for the professional and technical components only codes combined.

**5** = <u>**Incident To Codes**</u> -- This indicator identifies codes that describe services covered incident to a physician's service when they are provided by auxiliary personnel employed by the physician and working under his or her direct personal supervision. Payment may not be made by A/B MACs (B) for these services when they are provided to hospital inpatients or patients in a hospital outpatient department. Modifiers [[-26]] and [[-TC]] cannot be used with these codes.

**6** = <u>**Laboratory Physician Interpretation Codes**</u> -- This indicator identifies clinical laboratory codes for which separate payment for interpretations by laboratory physicians may be made. Actual performance of the tests is paid for under the lab fee schedule. Modifier [[-TC]] cannot be used with these codes. The total RVUs for laboratory physician interpretation codes include values for physician work, practice expense, and malpractice expense.

**7** = <u>**Physical therapy service, for which payment may not be made**</u> --  Payment may not be made if the service is provided to either a patient in a hospital outpatient department or to an inpatient of the hospital by an independently practicing physical or occupational therapist.

**8** = <u>**Physician interpretation codes:**</u> This indicator identifies the professional component of clinical laboratory codes for which separate payment may be made only if the physician interprets an abnormal smear for hospital inpatient. This applies to CPT codes [[85060]]. No TC billing is recognized because payment for the underlying clinical laboratory test is made to the hospital, generally through the PPS rate. No payment is recognized for CPT codes [[85060]] furnished to hospital outpatients or non-hospital patients. The physician interpretation is paid through the clinical laboratory fee schedule payment for the clinical laboratory test.

**9** = <u>**Not Applicable**</u> -- Concept of a professional/technical component does not apply
